RicciPy - Making Einstein possible in Python Symbols
====================================================

**RicciPy** is an open source package that exists as part of The EinsteinPy Project for the purpose
of providing a API that makes tensor algebra as easy as possible on arbitrary manifolds.
RicciPy implements the use of Sympy for representing tensor equations and expressions symbolically 
with automatic applications of a metric when contracting indices. Lastly, the Library also provides a
means for converting the results of tensor equations to numpy-like functions for use in numerical
calculations. It is released under the MIT license.
